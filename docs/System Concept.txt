System concept

Users can be in 3 roles: admin, scrum master, member.

Each user belongs to a house. A house basically means the teams belonging to same line management. Eg. House Kropek, House Kwekkwek.

Each user can participate to not more than 1 team.

Admin can create new teams and add story-tasks to teams.

Each story-task can be assigned to a member or a scrum master.

Monitoring of tasks is maintained within teams. For example,
RN team has more than 20 story-tasks each assigned to members of the RN team. Each member of the team can input the amount of hours he/she already consumed for the task.

Two metrics are important: actual hours and estimated hours.
Each member of the team should input the actual hours promptly. Estimated hours are created during planning.

One artifact is only made: a burndown chart per team.
